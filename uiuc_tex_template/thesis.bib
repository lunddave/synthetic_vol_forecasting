Quasi Maximum Likelihood (QML) methods ensure estimates are consistent and standard errors valid, even when the standardised innovations are non-normal or dependent, or both. Zero-coefficient restrictions by omission enable parsimonious specifications, and functions to facilitate the non-standard inference associated with zero-restrictions in the null-hypothesis are provided. Finally, in formal comparisons of precision and speed, the garchx package performs well relative to other prominent GARCH-packages on CRAN.},
