Abhinav: elapsed \approx system + user/cores

Abhinav: elapsed is most important.  Why?  User and system time reflect how much CPU time is being used.  Elapsed reflects real-world time.

system time is the time spent opening and closing processes


1) Anything surprising in results?
2) scale with n?
3) scale with ncores?
